# Data Analysis &amp; Visualization: Energy Consumption in the Netherlands

Energy consumption and sustainable development are eternal topics in modern society. Its importance makes it become the focus of this visualization task. This project investigate whether the energy consumption in Netherlands become more sustainable over the past years, and demonstrate valuable results obtained by utilizing several interactive visualization techniques.

## Data set
The data set we chose for our assignment is drawn from Kaggle Energy consumption of the Netherlands(https://www.kaggle.com/lucabasa/dutch-energy), consisting of over 520,000 rows of records. The data sets are collected from the three major network administrators of the Netherlands: Enexis, Liander and Stdein over the past ﬁve years. Their websites release tables with energy consumption of the assigned areas under their administration. These three network administrators are having more providing energy to the same zipcodes every year roughly.

## Analysis tasks
1. Overview of energy consumption First, we would like to know how much energy is being consumed per year(annual consume) at country level as well as the trend of other aspects of energy that contribute to the sustainability of the energy system over the ﬁve years.

2. The relation between self-providing energy and city Using self-providing energy not only help people save money but also have signiﬁcant contribution for country to become more sustainable. There are more and more people choose to become partial grid-reliance or partial self-reliance. Hence, we would like to explore what is the relation between self-providing energy and city.

3. The trend of Smart Meter deployment As explained in Smart grids en slimme engergiesystemen [4]. We believe that the coverage of smart grids increasing with time. We would like to conﬁrm this assumption with the help of visualization.

4. The impact of low tariff hours policy The low tariff(annual consume lowtariff perc) means that if your property has a meter ﬁtted, then from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. on weekdays and all day on weekends, the price of Internet, gas and electricity will be cheaper. In our dataset, the lowtariff hours policy is only applicable to the consumption of electricity. We hope to see whether the low tariff hours policy has inﬂuence on the electricity energy consumption.
